# The effect of broad and specific demographic homogeneity on the imposter distributions and false match rates in face recognition algorithm performance

## In a nutshell

  This work presents a framework to evaluate the disparate impact on biometric systems.
  It focuses basically on Impostor scores since it is claimed that this is mostly overlooked by the media.
  They confirmed that disparities appear between comparison in homogenous groups (e.g same gender, ethnicity, age, etc).
  
  
  Some insights about the framework.
    - They processed score distributions only from the 99th percentiles (tail scores are the most impacted indeed).
    - The framework consists in determining which covariate is the most impacted by disparities
      by analyzing the information gain of splitting risk scores using a particular covariate as a reference.
